# Thimblr

Thimblr lets you preview your [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com "Tumblr") themes right from your favorite editor. It protects your fingers from tedious copy-pasting a theme template into Tumblr's customize tool.

You can find Thimblr deployed here: [thimblr.heroku.com](http://thimblr.heroku.com/ "Thimblr - The easiest way to preview your Tumblr themes").

*This* Thimblr originally started as a fork of [J.P. Hasting's Thimblr](http://github.com/jphastings/thimblr "jphastings's thimblr at master - GitHub"). But since I basically changed everything around, I made it a new project.
Thimblr was originally inspired by [Mark Wunsch's Thimble](http://github.com/mwunsch/thimble "mwunsch's thimble at master - GitHub").

## Status

Thimblr is still in a very early stage and a lot of the Tumblr theme functionality is missing or not working properly.
